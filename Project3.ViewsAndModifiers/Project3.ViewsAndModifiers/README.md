>1. Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.
>2. Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.
>3. Go back to project 2 and create a FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
